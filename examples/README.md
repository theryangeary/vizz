# Vizz Examples

These examples demonstrate how to use the `Visualize` trait and the `Graph`
struct to generate DOT files for use with GraphViz.

Start with the `my_struct_derive` example for the most idiomatic use case. Check
out `my_struct_manual` and `my_enum_manual` for examples that show the
approximate code that is generated with the `#[derive(Visualize)]` macro.
